# team-perf-metric

## Introduction
The notion of "team performance" is the work horse (no pun intended) of management research. Nearly every study of groups or teams includes a measure of "performance," or the idea that some groups are simply better or more productive than others. Performance even underlies the reason why we choose to have teams at all. It is because teams have *synergy* (Larson, 2010) --- a "performance gain" from when a group of people collaborate rather than work alone --- that teamwork is so appealing. After all, if teams do not perform well together, why use them at all?

But as much as performance has been discussed in the literature, and as much as managers demand new ways to improve it, performance is, in reality, a somewhat elusive concept. The study of teams suffers from a "unit of analysis problem:" that is, because teams are composed of individuals, as well as products of their context, it is not obvious what one is truly measuring when one measures performance. 

This problem is by no means a new one. As Davis (1969) writes:

> It is commonly observed that “group behavior” is a function of three classes of variables: (a) person variables, such as abilities, personality traits, or motives; (b) environmental variables that reflect the effects of the immediate location and larger organization, community, or social context in which group action takes place; and (c) variables associated with the immediate task or goal that the group is pursuing.

Thus, performance is some unspecified mixture of the person, their environment, and their task. Other models echo this idea. A common framework for team performance posits that performance consists of some combination of *inputs* (the specific features of individuals on the team and the environment they belong to) and the *process* (the characteristics of their interactions together). A variant of this model has appeared in numerous papers across the decades (e.g., McGrath, 1964; Hackman and Morris, 1975; Dickinson and McIntyre, 1997; Cicek et al., 2005).

But these models really get us no closer to answering the question, what really is "performance?" Even if performance is just some combination of the people, their environment, and their process, we still don't have a "recipe" for what combination of these things constitutes strong performance. We don't even know what features within these broad categories matter.

### An Abundance of Theories
Social science traditionally focuses on studying just one variable at a time --- an approach known as the "one-at-a-time" experiment (Almaatouq et al., 2022, working paper). The literature on team performance is filled with papers that identify the role that a few specific variables play in improving team performance --- for example, having shared mental models (Kraiger and Wenzel, 2009); having discursive diversity (Lix et al., 2021); or being able to share workloads well (Campion, Medsker, and Higgs, 1993). We therefore have access to a large number of *individual theories* about team performance, but do not have a way to compare or unify them. After all, many of these studies are conducted on a diverse set of populations, doing various different tasks, and during entirely different decades. It's hard to say which of these theories dominates the measure of a team's overall quality; in fact, since many of these theories rely on vague concepts


*What is it* about the people, environment, and process are we looking for, when we measure for 'good performance?' How much of each one do we need --- do good people offset bad environments? Or does one bad ingredient poison the meal? And how do we measure these components, anyway? What does it mean to have "low conflict" or "high conscientiousness"?

## Building a "Map" of Team Performance
Our approach brings computer science and management science together. Specifically, we hope to develop an artifact that documents theories of team performance in a commensurable way, and which can then be used to learn models of team performance through (for now) text-based team interactions in different contexts.

This artifact may be thought of as a "feature list" for predicting performance.
