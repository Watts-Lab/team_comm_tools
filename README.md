# A Conversational Analysis Framework for Predicting Team Success through Team Communication Processes
Our project seeks to answer the question, “which types of team communication processes matter in different team activities?” Depending on the type of task at hand (Straus, 1999) or the context of the research study (Levinthal & Rosenkopf, 2020), some strategies may be more useful than others. Thus, how might we synthesize the myriad studies of team behavior — which take place across many tasks and contexts — into actionable insights for managers? In this project, we will extract team communication processes from the organizational behavior literature (for example, “Positivity,” “Information Exchange,” “Equal Participation”), and then measure these features on real teams’ communication transcripts across a variety of tasks. We will then use these measured features to predict which types of communication are most associated with team success across different activities.
