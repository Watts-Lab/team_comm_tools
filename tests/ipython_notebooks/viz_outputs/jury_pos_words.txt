                                                                                                                                                                           hes an asshole
                                                                                                             i think this person was not being an asshole if he was being polite about it
                                                                                          at first i did think this person was the asshole but i can see both sides of the picture here  
                                                                                                                                                    he didnt approach it in the right way
                                                                                                    if hed actually said im tired of your shit hed be an asshole but he tried to help her
                                        i understand learning a new language is difficult and there isnt an official language in the usa but learning english would be beneficial for her
                                                                                                                    he definitely is expecting a lot not everyone can learn new languages
                                                                                             i dont necessarily think what he said was wrong but the way he said it made him an asshole  
                                                                                                                                       he felt taken advantage of so he voiced his opinon
                                                                                                                                                   and the difference in ages is a factor
                                                                                                                                                             shes not his responsibility 
                                                                                                                    it seems like he got super frustrated and lashed out about it one day
                                                                                                                    also learning a new language is not as easy as he is making it sound 
                                              think about the mother though was she brought here  how old is she  how hard is it to learn a whole new language when youre already like 60
                                  i agree not everyone can learn languages and the way he went about it was def wrong  i would think its harder for an older person to learn the language
                                                                                                               i can imagine how annoying it would get having to be a translator everyday
                                                                                                                                       but she can not always rely on him for basic needs
                                                                                                                                               yeah he bottled it up and rageunleashed it
                                                                            he also stated that she tries to call other family members before calling him  seems like he is a last resort
                                                                                                                            so for that hes an asshole even if he tried to smooth it over
                                                                                                                                 she could use google translate or get a translation book
                                                                                                                 calling him a racist for not getting their way makes them unrespectable 
                                                                                                                     there are so many resources like apps she could use for basic things
                                                                                                                            i agree maybe he should have informed her of google translate
                                                                                                                                                               there are translation apps
                                                                                                             she does not have to become fluent in order to learn basic phrases to get by
                                                                                                                                                  yeah translation apps would have helped
                                                                                                                    i agree the racist trump supporting comments were totally unnecessary
                                                                                                                                   i just dont think he considered her learning situation
                                                                                                                              it is best for her and for him if she learned basic english
                                                                                                                                                 yes the trump stuff was very unnecessary
                                                                                                 yes he did not seem racist just an asshole but not by what he said how he went about it 
                                                                  yeah because it seems like he was suggesting learning english out of an actual necessity since she cant do basics alone
                                                                                                                                     learning a new language is hard but she needs to try
                                                                                                                                and it depends how often she is calling for translation  
                                                                                                                                            they seem entitled he was doing it as a favor
                                                                                                                               maybe he should have involved his wife in the conversation
                                                                                                                                                             he offered to help her learn
                                                                                                                                                 yes involving his wife would have helped
                                                                                                                                                         nicerhino then hed be an asshole
                                                                                                        in terms of showing her the tools he used and promising to help her along the way
                                                                                                                                        he was nice enough to provide other resources too
                                  he should have involved his wife but as long as he addressed his mil in a respectful way i dont think there is anything wrong with him telling her this
                                                                                                                                                                                    agree
             but then does she have access to a phone with apps because i know many older people have no clue how to use technology  his wife def should be involved in this conversation
                                                                                                                                                                                    agree
                                                                                                                              maybe not likelypig she could have helped the conversation 
                                                                                                                                                                                    agree
                                                                                                                                          shes got the phone if she calls him from places
                                                                                                                                                                                     true
he handled it poorly which is why he is the asshole in this scenario  really so are the family members for calling him a trumper but it feels like he could have had better control of it
                                                                                                                                  and they make simple phones especially for older people
                                                                                                                        i think he handled it well he just didnt word it well in the post
                                                                                             yes the family seemed to turn on him quickly which makes me think he did not handle it well 
                                                                      in his edit he said he did not address her in the way he intially explained so i dont think he was being an asshole
                                                                                                            he is not the asshole because he was thinking of what is best for her and him
                                                                                                                                                                      agree posted poorly
                                                                                                                    i think that he is the asshole for the way he handled the situation

                                                       the wife could have helped the conversation go smoother and be less of an attack towards the mother if she agreed with him that is
                                                                                                                                         he clearly was frustrated when he wrote the post
                                                                                                                      i think he is an asshole too  well intentioned but still an asshole
                                                                                                                                                                           youngcow agree

                                                                                                                                                                 maybe they all are tired

                                                                  i think since the mom only asks the poster when no one else is available poster is the asshole for getting so upset
                                    well when i read the first part of this i thought he was an asshole but the edit at the bottom if true shows he wasnt actually treating her badly
                                                                                                                                                                  good point youngcow
                                             i kind of feel like theyre both being jerks but the motherinlaw is overstepping her bounds and needs to respect her soninlaws boundaries
                                                                                                         who does she ask when someone else is available did it give that information
                                                                                  i think mil is being a littlebison bit imposing here and the son is law is right about what he said
                                                                                                                           i really hate when people throw white privilege in the mix
                                                                                                                                                           i think it is about trying
                                                                                                                               hes frustrated and it is a family issue so why do that
                                                                       i do think its unreasonable of him to say i learned a language super quickly and you can too its hard to do it
                                                                                                                              it says when she cant get ahold of other family members
                                                                                                                                          i think thats probably a real factor though
                                                                                                                                      yes i am leaning towards siding with the poster
                                                                                                            just give it a try you should be able to learn and he was willing to help
                                                                                                                                                        i agree with that littlebison
                                                                                                          they called him a trump supporter and racist seems disrespectful to do that
                                                                                                                                                                                 true
                                                                                                                                                if they say that its most likely true
                                                                                                                                            yeah that part insulting him was not cool
the mother has been in the country for 8 years true but if she is insulated in a spanish speaking community i can totally understand how she wouldnt have learned english well at all
                               if that part is true about what they saidhow they treated him its a huge problem but im not 100 sure i trust the poster based on the edit and his bias
                                                                                      i think if he really phrased it how he did in the edit that was a lot nicer and more reasonable
                                                                                                                                                                good point snappywolf

                                                         i honestly dont feel like hes an asshole at all and think he just got frustrated and she probably calls on him more than not
                                                                                  getting out of the bubble and learning everyday words with help from her sil should not be that bad

                                                                                                                                                             do with his wifes family
                                                 i dont think she should be bashed for not learning english but he shouldnt be bashed for not wanting to be a translator all the time

                                                                                                                                                                            likely so
                          i agree that the wife and mil are in the wrong here its not the husbands responsibility regardless of his beliefs about race or nationality or his own race
                      it is also important to think about how an english speaker would feel if they immigrated to a foreign country and didnt speak the language it is probably scary
                                                                     i think he is probably not the asshole and that obviously a nerve was plucked in the family over the whole thing
                                                                                                                   i understand his frustration and wanting the mom to be independent
                                                                                         but since we have to choose one side or the other i guess im learning toward not the asshole
                                                                                                              i agree littlebison littlebison thank you for teaching me that term lol

                                                                        i do not think he is an asshole remember he stated he was polite when bringing up the issue to his mil he is just venting on the reddit post
                                                                               his attitude is what makes him seem like an asshole to me i get that hes frustrated but learning new languages isnt easy for everyone
      my initial thought was this guy was being a bit petty is it that difficult to have a quick conversation with a family member when they need help it isnt always so easy to learn a new language later in life 
                                                              i dont think the husband is the asshole hes not nice at what hes writing but he says he acts politely and offers resources for them to help themselves
                    wow  what a pile of garbage this guy is  who yells at his inlaws like that  he comes across as a real good guy bragging about how smart he is because he took a couple of free internet programs
                                                                                                       some elder members of families like that just wont learn the language and its not up to the husband to decide
                                                                                                                                                                  i dont think his inlaws are respectful of his time
                                                                                                                                                                              acts politely  he cursed at his inlaws
                                                                                                             it never said he was super busy i mean my dad calls me all the time with ridiculous stuff and i pick up
                                         however their mil families reaction to instantly call him a racist is unfair espcially when he clearly took the time to learn spanish and has helped his mil plenty of time
                                                                           i dont think hes an asshole at all i think his family is full of them though  i dont think its white privlege to speak english in america
                                                                                                                        i dont know if i believe him when he says that he brought it up in a calm and respectful way
                                                                                                                                             where they just expect him to be there to help whenever the mil says so
                                                                                                                                                                                                 it is unfair to him
                                                                      yeah i understand that hes frustrated at whats happening it seems like he wasnt asked to be the default translator but his attitude isnt great
                                                                 at first i thought he came off as cocky but i do not think that he is after seeing that he was polite about it he also said he would help her learn
                                                                                                                         his typing wasnt very calm i have a hard time believing he was calm with the mother in law 
                                                                                                                              just more lazy hispanics that refuse to learn the language of the country they came to
                                                                                                                                                                                          lets take racism out of it
                                                                                                                                                                                            we dont have a language 
               i told her im sick of dealing with her shit because she cant speak english shes been here for 8 years she should be able to speak english by now in comparison i taught myself spanish and portuguese
                                                                                                                               its about assimilation into the country you live and being able to navigate the world
                                                                                                                                                                                                this is why he sucks
                                                                                                       if you immigrate you should be expected to adapt certain languages and customs that are native to the country
                                                                                                                                                                                                  are you guys real 
                                 he didnt learn spanish for the in laws specifically the wifes post pointed out that he already knew spanish i dont think he should have a say in whether or not they learn english 
                                        h learned to speak 3 languages in 3 years yet they cant learn to speak english in the 8 years theyve been here  thats just lazy and pathetic  go back to where you came from
                                                                                                                                                      i think hes trying to be helpful to his inlaws to empower them
                                                                                                                                                                                                             sprycow
                                                                                                                                                                                      you speak 3 languages fluently
                                                                                                               it is extremely hard to learn a language when you are an adult kids brains are much more adaptable   
                                                                                                                                                   learning a language can be easy for some people but not everyone 
                                                                                                                                                                                                   u miss quoted him
                                           it is unfair to him because he took initiative to learn another language he obviously felt was useful they should do the same since they want someone to always translate
                                                                                                                                                                                    read two words before your quote
                                                                                                                                                                                     its not about him in my opinion
                                                                                                littledonkey is spot on  learn to assimilate to the country you moved to including learning basics like the language
                                                                                                                                       he said that is what he did not say and that he was being polite on the phone
                                                                                                                            some people want to keep their culture and that could be why they never wanted to learn 
                                                                                            i wonder the ages of the parents too can they even use the links he sent my own father can barely do facebook and email 
                                                                                       id also like to rephrase something when explaining the situation to my mil i didnt tell her im sick of dealing with your shit
                                                                                                                                                                                         yeah i imagine they are old
                                                                                                                                                             i copied and pasted the quote  im not misquoting anyone
                                                                                                                                                                                                  clearly missquited
                                                                                                                                                                                            legit three words before
                                 being an immigrant doesnt immediately mean that you adopt all of the customs of the culture you immigrate into i think they should be allowed to speak whatever language they want 
                                            i understand wanting to keep your culture but theres no reason they cant learn the language of the country they came to live in  my grandparents did it so why cant they
i dont think he should just expect elderly parents will know and be able to use what information he sent to help out again i cant imagine my parent being that much of a pain by helping them get through daily life
                                                                                i think hes an asshole because of his entitled attitude he needs to talk to his wife and see if they can work something out together
                                                                                                                          especially forcing someone else to be your translator at hand in any situation at any time
                                                                                                                                                                         i guess he could just not answer the phone 
                                                                                                                          i think that he should not be the translator but he doesnt have to come across as arrogant
                                                                                                                                                                                                        lol sprygoat

                                                                                               we were asked not to put personal scenarios into this your grandparents are irrelevant here i think he is the asshole
                                                                                          so instead he politely brought up the issue to his mil and they instantly go to calling him a racist and a trump supporter
                                                                                                                                       they are defiantly not assholes at all and not entitled immigrants themselves
                                                                                                                 i question if he was really polite he had to edit his original post as it was complete asshole talk
                                                                                                                                                                                              no he is not the ahole
                                                                                                                                                                         yes because he his venting in a reddit post
                                                                                                                                                                                           you have to remember that
                                                                                                                                                                      i say yes but only because of the way he acted
                                                                                                                                   i dont see why its so hard to learn the language of the country youre living in

                                                                                                                                                                       i think he is an asshole for not going to his wife first
                                                                                                                                                                                    this is an everyone is an asshole situation
                                                                                                                                     while i dont think hes trying to be one i think the way he comes off makes him the asshole
                                                                            i think instead of pressuring her to learn english he could have started by saying that hes not going to be able to be as available as a translator
                                                                                                                                                                    i agree with inquisitivegorilla everyone here is an asshole
                                                                 i feel that he is an asshole because when it comes time to express his opinions even if he is coming from a valid place he comes across as rude and irritable 
                                                                                                                                                                                              he definitely comes off as a jerk
                                                                                     that puts the power in the mother in law where she can decide what to do to solve the problem of not having her son in law as a translator
                                                                                                                                yeah 8 years is a bit much to still need help with simple things like is the family even trying
                                                                                                                                                                             he comes across as a jerk even in his online posts
                                     the parants should not be putting the burden on the entire family the wife should not be pushing it on her husband and he should just not answer like the rest of the family probably does
                                                                           i totally agree he is an asshole how can you be that harsh on an older lady mind you its much easier to learn especially another language when young
                                                                                                                                                he shouldnt have to translate but he shouldnt force he parents to learn english
i think this person was right in encouraging his mil to become more independent in learning english and not rely on him several times a day for translations the mil has been in the country long enough to speak basic english
                                                           hes an asshole for many reasons but first on my list is this assumption that because he learned a few languages quickly that anyone can not all of us are that smart
                                                                                                                                                               he could also try and teach them some english if he has the time
                                                                                                                                           and as delightedzebra noted shes older and therefore its going to be harder to learn
                                                                                                                             also weve gotta note the edit where he clarified that he tried to be respectful instead of saying 
                                                                                                                                        the problem is he doesnt sound very encouraging at all he comes across as very negative
                                                                                                                         he is not considerate in my opinion because of the age gap what if she has some learning deficiencies 
                                                                                                                                              right people who speak english dont understand how hard it is for others to learn
                                                                                     english is such a difficult language i am sympathetic to anyone trying to learn it im a native speaker and even i get tripped up regularly
                                                                                                                                        the mil may be older but not incapable of learning a new language thats just an excuse 
                                                                                               i dont think he has to be a translator but learning a new language is a daunting task no matter how much youre surrounded by it 
                                                                                                                                                                                          in the edit he also swore at everyone
                                                                          im not saying shes incapable its just a slower process im slowgoing in learning a new language myself probably due to my age its just such a struggle
                                                                                                                                                                                he was expressing his frustration in the credit
                                                                                                                                                                               yeah he seems like an asshole to us as well haha
                                                                                                                           it is hard but it is impossable if you never try and translating all the time doesnt help them learn
                                                                                                                                                                                             he definately came across terribly
                                            its funny if his post had come off less negative and frustrated he mightve changed opinions  instead he comes off as an asshole just because of his tone even if he has some points
                                                                                                                                                                 i consider him to be an asshole because he is not considerate 
                                                                                                                                                            nowadays you can get a translator on a smartphone for simple things
                                                                                                                  i think the situation didnt make him an asshole but the way he seems to have handled it makes him the asshole
                                                                                                                                                                                     i think everyone in the senario are aholes
                                                                                                                                                                                                         i agree with openhippo
                                                                                                 yes agreed that its his handling of the situation that makes him the asshole he cant express his opinion in a constructive way
                                                                                                                        his saying he was tired of her shit made him look like the asshole at first until he added to the post 
                                                                                                                                                                              dang two minutes left and we are all in agreement
                                                                                     if he sounded like he was more doing it out of mutual benefit then i might have seen it differently but he was doing it solely for himself
                                                                                                                                                                                        im not i dont think he was the asshole 
                                                                                                                  yes this one is a no brainer his assumption that everyone is capable of learning fast like him is very wrong 
                                                                                                                                                                                                  i think they are all assholes
                                                                                                                                                                                        uh oh dissent  ha ha sorry excitedcamel
                                                                                                                                                                                             i think we need a surprise witness
                                                                                                                                          i think if he approached this with less of a negative attitude i would change my mind
                                                                                                                                                                                               im just looking at it different 
                                                                                                                                                                                               yeah he comes across like a jerk
                                                                                                                                                       id be upset too if someone kept pestering me for translation work though
                                                                                                                                                                       so i can see where he is frustrated with the experience

                                                                                                        i understand that always being relied on to act as translator is exhausting and frustrating but he didnt need to be mean about it 
                                             he is being cruel by flippantly suggesting that she just learn english there may be a lot of outside circumstances that make it a lot harder for his mother in law to access english learning
                                                  she might not have the time or the money or honestly the confidence he is being an asshole here by basically saying the mother is dumb because she cant just pick up a foreign language 
               i believe he was being polite to his mother in law but abrasive in his post still that is family and he should be there for her while it might have been easy for him to learn multiple languages in a short period of time
                                                                                                                                                                          it is obviously not as easy for her he needs to learn compassion
                                                                                              even if he says he was polite when he spoke to her im sure his tone came through you can tell by the language he uses he doesnt respect her 
                                                                                                                                                               i cant imagine that it happens all that often anough for him to be so angry
                            in my opinion i dont think the author is the asshole if you live in japan you should learn japanese its been 8 years as the author stated that is ample time to learn it offhand just by having conversations 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          i agree he needs some compassion
      even though i could imaging that it is hard to always be a translator it is also insensitive to put someone down for not wanting to learn another language learning languages is hard and its not right to pressure someone to do so
                                              its a lot more difficult for older people to learn a foreign language he should recognize that his ability to pick up spanish is indeed a privilege and shouldnt expect that of other people
                                                                                                                                                                                        japan is an example i know they live in california
                                                                                                                                                     marriage is about compromise he should just do it for his wife if for no other reason
                                                                                                                                                               i do think she should learn engligh enough to be able to have a life though
                                                                                                                                                                im not trying to be combative but have you ever lived in a foreign country
                                                                                                                                                        if i lived anywhere for 8 years its customary to speak their predominant language 
                                                   he just seems like an asshole he could have totally approached the matter in a different its great he was able to pick up on different languages maybe he could reach out and tech them
                                                                                                                                  its really disorienting stressful and anxiety inducing most of the time you dont just pick up a language
                                                                                                                                                              i agree marriage is about compromise learning a new language is no easy feat
                                                                                                                            after 8 years she should be able to at least have a limited conversation or take someone with her to translate
                                                                                                    she lives in an area with mostly spanishspeaking people so it seems like she mightve been able to get around just fine without english
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    thats true curiousbear
                                                         it does not sound like she is out in the world a lot otherwise she would be able to do more if everyone around her speaks her own language then it would be hard to learn english
                                                         learning a new language is very difficult i know its been almost a decade anyone with 8 years worth of time in a different country should be able to order food at the very least
 theres just going to be situations with more difficult vocabulary that she requires a translator even if she learned english with the rate of a second language acquisition itd be very difficult for her to prepare for these rare cases
                                                                                            i have to say i really disagree i think its easy to learn stuff like please and thanks but having a discussion is an entirely different matter
                                                                                                                                                                    also consider the fact english is the most difficult language to learn
                                                                                                                                                                                                 yeah english makes no sense gramatically 
                           i feel he is in the wrong here it does not sound like he is translating for her every day and since he is obviously intelligent enough to know multiple languages then maybe he should be the one teaching her 
if its occasionally she needs a translator then he is the asshole but as he was stating it its for essentially everything what if the husband is busy he has a life too and i think its selfish if shes calling him every day to translate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             grammatically
                                                                                                                                                                                             somehow i get the feeling he is exaggerating 
                                         i do understand why he might be frustrated even though he isnt the only one that she goes to for translation he might feel that because he is not blood family that does have the same obligation
                                                                                                                                                                                                          the post said sometimes calls me
                                                                                                                                                               it sounded like it was only when no one else was available that it happened
                                                                                                i just cant imagine that this woman is calling him multiple times per day per week i too understand the frustration but he is being a jerk
                                                                                                                                                                                      if he is exaggerating then i agree he is the asshole
                                                                                                                                                             yep hes the asshole even reading his statement he sounds like an angry person
                                                                                                                                                                                                                yes i think hes an asshole
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      yeah def the asshole

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    everyone needs to vote

                      so im thinking that she is the asshole here too seems to me like she isnt taking her husbands concerns seriously and is avoiding the work to help her family
                                              my thought is she should have equally been taking the calls instead of passing them on and choosing that she is more busy than he is
                                                                                                                   granted the husbands initial action may have ticked her off too
                                              seeing the other side of this situation makes it seem that she didnt show any appreciation to the husband for doing this for so long
                                                                                                                                                                              yeah
                                                                                                                                                                              yeah
                                                             i think that she hsould be helping  and having more time is a dangerous perception for your significant other to have
                                                                                      the husband pretty much tried but she was being the selfish one so id say she is the asshole
                                                               i think she was less dramatic about it just like annoyed at my hubs vibe but that she is also in the wrong here too
                    i see the writer side and his side it makes also feel in between she was dramatizing it her husband did come off a little angry which could cause her reaction
                                                   seemed like it was a small deal for her but a large one for her spouse and then she doesnt understand how its a big deal to him
                                                                                     and trying to say that her parents have done enough and dont have to learn is simply ignorant
                                                                                                                                 they both seem defensive instead of communicating
                                                                   there would probably not have been a problem if both shared the responsibility equally but she pushed it on him
                                                                                                                                                                          exactly 
                                                                                                                                               they both seemed defensive to me to
                                                                                                                                   on the need to communicate better notion i mean
                                                                                         the family should also try harder to learn the language of the country they are living in
                                                                                                                     i believe they both needed better communiction on the subject
                                                                                      i mean i dont think there is anyone completely in the right  all are at least somewhat wrong
                               i think she is the asshole in the situation as well not for being defensive of her parents but for not being open to her husband about his concerns
                                                                                                                                                                            agreed
                                                            yeah even if there is no official language of the land they should know how to communicate with the most used language
                                                                            communication is important but i still dont believe the wife was listening to the husbands side at all
                                                                                                                                                                     asshole  yupp
                                                                                                                                                                             agree
                                                                                                                                        agreed i see both sides being in the wrong
                                                                                                        i think we agreed pretty quickly here haha two wrongs do not make a right 
                                                                                                                                                                        that right
                                                                                                                                     and if we people dont communicate no one wins
                                                                                                                                                                     agree on that
                                                                                                                                                      communication for the win yo
i do not think she was listening and i think it is very possible that he was communicating poorly as well they should figure out how to talk to each other and stop being assholes
                                                                                                                                                   communication is always the key
                                                                                                                                     unless you have a lock  then a key is the key
                                                                                                                                         its a fundamental soft skill to any skill
                                                                                                                                        they should both calm down and talk it out
                                                                                                                                            face to face too not through textcalls
                                                                                                                  i stand by my thoughts on this that yes she was being an a hole 
                                                                                                                                now if we get the moms perspective in the next one
                                                                                                                                                             she is an asshole too
                                                                                                                                                         i stand by what i said to
CONVERSATION 192 
                                                                                                                      i dont think this person is the asshole
                                                                                                                               this guy is totally an asshole
                                                                                                                   i dont think so he said he was respectful 
                                 i think after he explained that he was willing to help and was polite and respectful he cleared himself of being the asshole
                                                                                                                                what he said wasnt respectful
                                                                                                 its not his responsibility to be a translator 24 hours a day
                                                                  i think he would still be willing to help just they also need to commit to learning english
                                                                                                   if it was every once in a while it would be understandable
    i think the way the guy talked was like an asshole but if he spoke respectfully to his mother in law about learning english he wasnt one in the situation
                                                                    i think he came off harsh because of his language but he actually sounded kind of sincere
                                                            i think when dealing with family members it should have been the wife that said something not him
                                                                                       he also said he was willing to help the mother in law any way he could
                                                                                    but if he is being called randomly throughout the whole day its a problem
                                                                   i also believe he is an asshole   i do not think he was respectful in dealing with his mil
                                                                                                     yes it is not clear how often he is being asked to help 
                                                                           just because he learned languages easily does not mean that the mother in law will
                                       honestly it would be hard to deal with calls all day if she cant even order food for herself so i get the frustration 
                                                                                                                             i agree with that fulfilledbison
                                                                                                                                                       agreed
                                                                                         but that doesnt mean she shouldnt at least try to learn the language
                                                        even though he said he was willing to help the mil he tone and words were disrespectful in my opinion
                                                                                     barely being able to order food at a restaurant is really bad though lol
                                                                   yes that is true may be harder for his mother in law to learn but she should at least try 
                                                       it seems like she doesnt even want to learn she just wants everything done her way and in her language
                                                                                         but i know not everyone learns english easily or any other language 
                                                                                                                        thats just not the reality in the usa
       like i can understand needs help with taxes or applying for something but if you cant interact with people at the store or something thats a real pain
                                                                                             yeah she definitely should learn some of the very basics though 
                                                                       if she put effort into learning and just wasnt getting it id be way more understanding
                                                                           the guy is probably getting calls all day about how to translate very minor things
                                                                                      i can see both sides but he sounded so harsh i think it puts people off
                                                                                                                                 yes i agree his tone is bad 
                                                                                                                   i just think everyone has a breaking point
                                                                             his tone was bad but he also cleared it up and said he was polite and respectful
                                                                                                what does flaunting white priveledge have to do with anything
                                 it would be a good thing if the mother in law used available resources to learn english  it would probably ease the tensions
                                                                                    but if he really was respectful to her then i dont think hes the asshole 
                                                                                                                             i just dont think hes an asshole
                       but i think his tone and language being bad is something we should kind of ignore it makes him look worse than maybe hes really acting
                                                                                                                                                i dont either
                                                                  seems like he is being called all day and it just got to him i dont think he is the asshole
                                                                                          asking someone to try to learn a language is 100 a fine thing to do
                                                                                               not trying and just using someone as a translator 247 is wrong
                                                                                                                              i would say not the asshole too
                                                                            he thinks he was respectful but i disagree  he could have phrased it more kindly 
                                                                                i highly doubt this guy is flipping out over translating a few things a month
                                                                                                                                 yes i agree not the asshole 
                                                                                                           but he said that the mother in law sometimes calls
                                                                                                       it has to be quite often for him to be this frustrated
                                                                                                            it doesnt sound like she calls as much as is told
                                                                                                                                              its hard to say
                                                                                                                          yes or he has a low breaking point 
                                                                                                         yeah i could see it being very annoying after awhile
                                                                            i just dont think someone would be getting mad being called like 23 times a month
                                                                                                        and she calls when she cant get ahold of someone else
                                                                                                                            so she doesnt even call him first
the mih should be strongly encouraged to learn english and the family should be supportive  perhaps she lacks confidence and needs someone to encourage her  
                              the last thing someone wants to do when they get home from work is be hounded and having to do things that they dont want to do
                                                                                                                                    we all just want to relax
                                                                                                                 this person is not the asshole in my opinion
                                                                                                                     i dont think the mother in law is either
                                                                                                                          she should attempt to learn english
                                                                                                             i just think theres no asshole in this situation
                                                                                         i still dont think the person in the assshole based on what we know 
                                                                        i dont think they are an asshole and i feel she should at least try to learn english 
                                                                                                                                             same livelyzebra

                                                                                                                                                                i think shes the asshole
                                                                                                              so shes mad at him for not liking her dump her parents on him all the time
                                                                                                                                        i felt that she was overwhelmed by her situation
                                                                                                                                  i agree personally im leaning towards shes the asshole
                                                                                                                                                     i definitely think shes the asshole
                                                                                                          it is assholish for her to pass the responsibilty of her mother to her husband
                                                                                                                         the key is she admits she is trying to make my husband    do it
                                                                                                                                  if she doesnt have time for her mom than why should he
                                                                                                                                                           i dont feel she is an asshole
                                                                                                                        i think it shouldnt be a problem as long is its not all the time
                                                                                                                                              she flat out said she dumped it off on him
                                                                                if it shouldnt be a problem for him to spare 10mins why cant she also spare that time for her own mother
                                                                                                             again when you marry into hispanic culture you have to care for the parents
                                                                                                                                    because she values her time more than she values his
i hated the fact that she said she felt she had to be t he trailblazer for her family and lead the way she couldnt have thought to teach her parents some english as she was learning it
                                               she is in the wrong    she shouldnt be making him pressuring him    she should be helping her mom herself or getting her mom a translator
                                                                                              yeah but shes not shes making her husband do it and doing something else she prefers to do
                                                 i feel like the way shes talking about her husband is pretty assholeish but i dont think asking for his help is necessarily a bad thing
                                                                                                                                                       he knew what he was marrying into
                                                                                               she has no right to get mad at him for not wanting to do it she doesnt even want to do it
                                                                                                                                         they also make fun of him and call him a gringo
                                                                                                    asking him for help is not bad but making him that is pressuring manipulating etc is
                                                                                       asking for his help isnt a bad thing but making him do something she wont make time for is unfair
                                                                                                                                                 he had to communicate in spanish before
                                                                                                                            it is completely understandable to ask for help occasionally
                                                                                                                                                              great point curiousgiraffe

                                                                                                                                 i think she is simply an asshole for being mad about it
                                                                                                                                  oh yeah if she asked and he was willing help then sure
                                                                                                                            help is part of marriage when  you are supporting each other
                                                                                                                                      but she literally said im busy so i made him do it
                                                                                                           she even said she was working full time while going to school for her masters
                                                                                   occasional help is better than feeling like your life is on hold which is what the husband feels like
                                                                                                     yeah but its not an equal trade off shes putting her half all on him thats not fair
                                                                                                                                          helping is a gift you cant make someone do it 
                                                                                                                                                 shes not considering her husband at all
                                                                                                    she is putting more expectations on him than she is willing to do for her own mother
                                                                                                                             she is blinded by her desire to be the savior of her family
                                                                                                         she is also an enabler she never thought to even help her parents learn english
                                                                                                        her parents should have learned how to navigate in the country the immigrated to
            i feel like she doesnt think her parents should have to learn english based on what she said at the end about working hard and they dont need that on top of everything else
                                                                                                                       hello not being a savior but bettering her self through education
                                                                                                       she should ease up and then her husband might feel less pressure and want to help
                                                                                                                           i can understand why shes upset but its just a bit too strong
                                                                                                                                                    good way of putting it livelygorilla
                                                                        he has a job responsibilities and parents to take care of too he cant do all this for her while she does nothing
                                                                                                                                   i guess none of you went back to school with a family
                                                                                                   perhaps if they had a decent conversation about it they could talk it out like adults
                                                                                                                                                            actually i did a phd program
                                                                           the simple fact that shes mad she cant throw this off on her husband and is mad about it makes her an asshole
                           honestly if shes working on her masters while working full time then shes not likely taking a full time school schedule or her work is not horribly stressful
                                                                                                                          life is hard that is why spouses pick up when things get tough
                                                                                                                                                           its like its her way or ot ok
                                                                                                                      as someone who worked full time while pursuing a masters full time
                                                     maybe her other family members could take on this responsibility if shes so busy and its so important to take care of their parents
                                                                                                                                         even for the inlaws whether you like them or no
                                                                                                            there have to be other people who can helpwhy does it have to be her husband
                                                                                                                               he married into the family theyve been her family forever
                                                                                                         thats a good idea  maybe the husband can be back up to the other family members
                                                                                      yeah theyve just become his responsibility all the time without even talking to him about it first
                                                                                                                                       shes not taking an of the responsibility or blame
                                                                                                                                                      didnt say if they had other familu
                                                                                         i would be curious to know what the other family members do are they in school working at home 
                                                                                                                                        uh she had been the support up until the masters
                                                                                                                                                  im full on set she is the asshole here
                                                                                                                                                  so hubby has been helping for how long
                                                                                                                                                  her attitude of making him says it all
                                                                                                                                                                         100 the asshole

                                                                                                                                                                     nope not an asshole
                                                                                                                                                                           she is the ah

                                                                                                                                                                         im gonns say is
                                                                she sounds like she believes her time is more important than his while hes likely making more at his job to support them
                                              i agree shes the asshole  she doesnt respect her husband and is trying to push of something that should be a joint responsibility onto him
                                                                                                                        well i think she is not the asshole considering the circumstance
                                                            the writer is acting very disrespectful in this scenario and isnt considering the feelings of her husband she is the asshole
CONVERSATION 281 
                                                                                                                            the son is the asshole here for sure
                                                                                                i think they should speak in english in respect to their hostess
                                                                                                                                 mom just wanted to eb included 
                                                                                       i would side with the mother but she probably did handle it the wrong way
                                                                                              this is a challenging case i do not prefer how the mum handled it 
                                                                                                                                    the mom asked nicely it says
                                                                                                                         and the sons husband speaks english too
                                                                                                                                     yes the mom did ask nicely 
                                                                                                        ya it said mom was respectful when she said how she felt
mom is an a agreed it was not appropriate for them not to be speaking in english when they could  but she should not have made an issue with a guest in her home
                                                                                                                         the boyfriend seemed like the most jerk
                                                                                                                               son is clearly the ahole no doubt
                                                                                            right if he could speak english he should have so no one is left out
                                                         like she was right but its one of those things you dont really need to call someone out for on the spot
                                                     i agree the son was the a hole here mom just wanted to be included and as hosted i feel she had that right 
                                                                                                                                                 exactly i agree
                                                     i do not believe the mum is in the wrong here if the tables were reversed she may not get the time of day  
                                                                      she probably did not want the whole visit to be this way and that is why she brought it up
                                                                                                     i wonder why the bf was so disrespectful seems weird to me 
                                                                                                               i agree the boyfriend is the biggest a hole here 
                                                                                                              i dont know leaves a bad impression for the mother
                                                                                                                          leaves a terrible impression on the bf
                                                                                                                        makes you think she might be too uptight
                                                                                                                                                oops  for the bf
                                                                                               im sure the partner would have felt the same if tabes were turned
                         sometimes  you want to converse about an issue in the language you are comfortable in  even though you know a bit of the other language
                                                                                             yeah they were both disrespectful to the mother who was the hostess
                                                                                                               she did say that he had hardly spoken in english 
                                                                                                                                mom spoiled the mood of everyone
                                                                                                                                                         exactly
                                                                                                                                     she had the right to though
                                                                                                               the partner was sulky to just leave the room rude
                                                                                                                             but mom just wanted to be included 
                                        language is precious reflects identity but the boyfriend was so rude he could speak to the mum but didnt much in english
                                                                                           the mom needed to be included and it really wasnt that hard to do soo
                                                               was she supposed to deal with that feeling left out the whole time instead of not saying anything
                                                                                                                                      exactly like thats her son
                                                                                                                maybe not the right time to discuss her feelings
                                                                                                       maybe the partner was really nervous and shy or something
                                                                                                                             i feel she handled it ina okay way 
                                                      of course ideally english should have been spoken but she didntt have to create bad feelings unnecessarily
                                         yeah but it seems like the bf didnt realize he was being rude but probably felt embarrassed to be called out like that 
                                                                                                        eh she asked nicely tho its not like she threw a tantrum
                                                                                                                                          im glad she was honest
                                                                                                     i agree the how maybe was not executed correctly by the mum
                                                                                                                         but she was sincere so i cant fault her
                                                                                    exactly she was honest its the sonboyfriends fault for throwing off the vibe
                                                                                          partner needs to bring her flowers and apologize and thank his hostess
                                                                                                                                                         exactly
                                                                                                             i agree  that would have been the right thing to do
                                if she had not called them out it would have stayed a good atmosphere she was the one to have been more mature in this situation
                                                                     i guess my thing is when i stay with someone else i do things with them not leave them out 
                                                                                             like who wouldnt want to make a good impression on your sos parents
                                                             brightdolphin if it were me i would learned some french to ask please include me i dont understand 
                                                               i just feel that by the boyfriend not speaking to her made it okay for her to ask to be included 
                                                                                                                                                  lol  i love it

                                             there is something called being a nice host calling your guest out for a small matter doesnt reflect that mom iis a

                                                                                                                                         definitely sounds like an asshole with his mindset
                                                                                                                                       also does anyone else find this post familiar at all
                                                                                                                               i agree  it is harsh to tell others to just learn a language
                                                    i also thought he was an asshole for the way he treated the mom and his mindset since english really isnt a national language of the us
                                                                                                                                          all of my posts have been about language barriers
                                                                                                                                                         i understand that he is frustrated
                                                                                                                                               it can come easy for some but not for others
                                                                      i kinda agree with him that she should be learning english but it sounds like he went about it the complete wrong way
                                                                             when he flaunts his own achievements i think he also is taking for granted his motherinlaws age and experience
                                                                                         plus he sounded so arrogant when he said he learned languages in 2 years so why cant everyone else
                                                                                                                                            it might be ideal but not necessarily realistic
                                                                                 also likewhy did you learn those languages just to likenot use them just so you can say you can speak them
                                                                                                                         i did not like the part about telling her to get her shit together
                                                                                                           english is not a national language of the us its not a necessity to be a citizen
                                                                                                                   sure its useful but to tell someone off for not knowing english is wrong
                                                                                                         it seemed like he changed his tune at the end of the story because he got backlash
                                                                  but the vast majority speak english here so in order to adequately communicate with the majority you need to know english
                                                                                                                                     yeah he has a very aggressive tone in the initial post
                                                                                                                               he didnt help himself by outing himself as a trump supporter
                                                                                                                                                   i feel like it speaks to his personality
                                                                                                    but its not a requirement he was just incredibly rude in how he interacted with the mom
                                                                                                                   he said at the end of story that he was polite and spoke respectful tone
                                                                                                            i was trying to look at other sides but i say off with his head hes the asshole
                                                                                                                                       he was aggressive in his post to complete strangers 
                                                 why not just help out the relatives and in the process help them learn a bit of english too without worrying about whether itll be enough 
                                                                                              oh i definitely agree that he was super rude should have gone about it completely differently
                                                         i think its good that he offered her tools like duolingo but i feel like he probably didnt take the time to show her how they work
                                                                                                                                             i agree i think its great to share resources  
                                                                                                                                                     seems like greater patience would help
                                                                                           he just needs to go about it in a better way and he needs to change his mindset about immigrants
                               as someone who speaks multiple languages i will just say that if i dont feel like translating for someone i just dont answer the phone from those people lol
                                                                                                      i agree he also married into the situation and its weird its like he suddenly snapped
                                                                                                 i look at it and im like nah not right now and put the phone down and go about with my day
                                                                                                                                                                good point openelephant lol
                                                                                     i also speak multiple languages but its a different mindset you might have since the wifes a first gen
                                                                                                                  he could be more helpful in helping the family members to help themselves
                                                                                                                                                           theres a sense of responsibility
                                                                                                                                                              yes he should be more helpful
                                                                                                               there could be a component of stubbornness on the part of the family members
he doesnt owe them anything sure but he married into this family and its disrespectful to treat them the way he did i just think he should offer to show them duolingo etc in a kind manner
                                                                                                                                                 but that doesnt mean he has to be so pushy
                                                                                                                           yeah which would warrant frustration but this guy just unhinged 
                            since the task is really to judge from evidence in the post alone especially its tone and language used i feel like hes definitely the asshole in this instance
                                                                                                                                         so it sounds like that we agree he is the asshole 
                                                                                                                                                                                 agreed 100
                                                                             seems like this person is indeed an asshole who could be way more respectful in helping out his family members
                                                                                                                                                      i am in agreeance that hes an asshole
                                                                                                                      he is the asshole because of his treatment of the family and his tone
                                                                                                                                                                                    i agree
                                                                                                         at best hes just trying to hide that hes actually an asshole by all his politeness
                                                                                                                                                                                       true
