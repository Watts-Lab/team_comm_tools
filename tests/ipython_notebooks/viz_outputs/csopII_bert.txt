                                          now try to solve conflicts
                                            enough time to try again
                                                     i dont think so
                                                     i like this one
                                                         its not bad
                                                           same here
                                                        i noted them
                                                               happy
                                                     if we wanna try
                                                          we can try
                                                            we got 5
maybe the next one will have fewer people so more time to experiment
                      i think if we should just to improve from here
                                          actually im good with this
                   see if any switches will result in a better score
                                              too many moving pieces
                                                     not enough time
                                    too much room to mess up lets go
                                                             oh snap

                              look for ones wilth the least conflict
                                                   then check points
                                                     then check rule
                     one change at a time is good strategy this late
                                                                haha

are we doing the same strat as before just placing them where their points are highest
                                                                     yea to start with

                                                             so many in the same rooms
                                                     this is gonna be a bit more messy
                                                                                   yup

                                   now is there something we can do to get more points
                                                                        f is kinda low
                                                            can we swap c and d with f
                                                                    nvm no we cant lol
                                                                   there is good for f
                                                                               i agree
                                                              this seems pretty decent

                                          oh boy here we go
                          k i think we keep the strat going
                                           it seems to work
                                                    i agree
                   okay not quite as bad as it couldve been
                              ill work from bottom up again
                                    sounds like a good plan
                                actually not bad pointswise
                                             g is kinda low
                                           yeah same with o
                             lets see if we can wiggle them
                                 im actually kinda confused
        yeah theres so much going on its hard to keep track
        it seems like im supposed to get more points in 108
                                          if i move m and o
                                     but the points go down
                                   wait what thats so weird
                            that actually shouldnt be right
                                                        lol
             is it because we also need to move p with them
                                i guess im okay with it tbh
                                                        hmm
                         ends up being pretty much the same
                                           still its better
true we might just have to settle with some unhappy campers
                                                         oh
                                                        ooh
                                    its actually not better
                                                        lol
                                                       welp

                                       this seems good then

alright so we lose but thats still slightly higher than 776 lol
           and yes they need to learn to get along for our sake
                                 do all rooms have to be filled
                                    or just all students placed
                     no just all the people need to be in rooms

       is there anyway to get p higher score
                     then you have to move o
                                       and m
                                       and m
                                         yes
                                not worth it
                        108 is too low for p
         yeah i think o and m are at the max
               should we try to move those 3
                           lol i added 4 pts
