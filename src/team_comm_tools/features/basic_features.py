	This function is trivial; by definition, each message counts as 1. However, at the conversation level, we use this function to count the total number of messages/utterance via aggregation.
	
	Args:
		text (str): The message (utterance); not used in the function.

	Return:
		int: 1 (as each message trivially contains 1 message)
