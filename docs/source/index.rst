The Team Communication Toolkit
===============================
Welcome to the official documentation of the Team Communication Toolkit! If you're a social scientist looking to explore conversational data, or just someone interested in better understanding the dynamics of team conversations, you've come to the right place.

Getting Started
****************

To use our tool, please ensure that you have Python >= 3.10 installed and a working version of `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_, which is Python's package installer. Then, in your local environment, run the following:

.. code-block::

   pip install team_comm_tools


You will also need to manually install some additional required dependencies to set up the package. In your terminal, run the following:

.. code-block::
   
   ./setup.sh


Once complete, you should see, "Installation and requirements check completed successfully." This means you are ready to go!
