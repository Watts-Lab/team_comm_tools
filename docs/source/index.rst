The Team Communication Toolkit
===============================
Welcome to the official documentation of the Team Communication Toolkit! If you're a social scientist looking to explore conversational data, or just someone interested in better understanding the dynamics of team conversations, you've come to the right place.

Getting Started
****************

To use our tool, please ensure that you have Python >= 3.10 installed and a working version of `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_, which is Python's package installer. Then, in your local environment, run the following:

.. code-block::

   pip install team_comm_tools

You will also need to ensure that Spacy and NLTK are installed in addition to the required dependencies. The Spacy model should download ``en_core_web_sm`` automatically upon install. If you get an error that en_core_web_sm is not found, you should run the following in your terminal:

.. code-block::

   spacy download en_core_web_sm

Additionally, we require several NLTK dependencies. If you don't have them in your environment, run this one-liner in your terminal:

.. code-block::

   import_nltk

Import Recommendations: Virtual Environment and Pip
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We strongly recommend using a virtual environment in Python to run the package.** We have several specific dependency requirements. One important one is that we are currently only compatible with numpy < 2.0.0 because `numpy 2.0.0 and above <https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/2.0.0-notes.html#changes>`_ made significant changes that are not compatible with other dependencies of our package. As those dependencies are updated, we will support later versions of numpy.

**We also strongly recommend that your version of pip is up-to-date (>=24.0).** There have been reports in which users have had trouble downloading dependencies (specifically, the Spacy package) with older versions of pip. If you get an error with downloading ``en_core_web_sm``, we recommend updating pip.

After you import the package and install dependencies, you can then use our tool in your Python script as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   from team_comm_tools import FeatureBuilder

*Note*: PyPI treats hyphens and underscores equally, so "pip install team_comm_tools" and "pip install team-comm-tools" are equivalent. However, Python does NOT treat them equally, and **you should use underscores when you import the package, like this: from team_comm_tools import FeatureBuilder**.

Using the Package
******************

Once you import the tool, you will be able to declare a FeatureBuilder object, which is the heart of our tool. Here is some sample syntax:

.. code-block:: python

   my_feature_builder = FeatureBuilder(
      input_df = my_pandas_dataframe,
      # this means there's a column in your data called 'conversation_id' that uniquely identifies a conversation
      conversation_id_col = "conversation_id",  
      # this means there's a column in your data called 'speaker_id' that uniquely identifies a speaker
      speaker_id_col = "speaker_id",
      # this means there's a column in your data called 'messagae' that contains the content you want to featurize
      message_col = "message",
      # this means there's a column in your data called 'timestamp' that conains the time associated with each message; we also accept a list of (timestamp_start, timestamp_end), in case your data is formatted in that way.
      timestamp_col= "timestamp",
      # this is where we'll cache things like sentence vectors; this directory doesn't have to exist; we'll create it for you!
      vector_directory = "./vector_data/",
      # give us names for the utterance (chat), speaker (user), and conversation-level outputs
      output_file_path_chat_level = "./my_output_chat_level.csv", 
      output_file_path_user_level = "./my_output_user_level.csv",
      output_file_path_conv_level = "./my_output_conversation_level.csv",
      # if true, this will combine successive turns by the same speaker.
      turns = False,
      # these features depend on sentence vectors, so they take longer to generate on larger datasets. Add them in manually if you are interested in adding them to your output!
      custom_features = [  
            "(BERT) Mimicry",
            "Moving Mimicry",
            "Forward Flow",
            "Discursive Diversity"
      ],
   )

   # this line of code runs the FeatureBuilder on your data
   my_feature_builder.featurize(col="message")
