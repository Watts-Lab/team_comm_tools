Features: Conceptual Documentation
==================================

In contrast with the :ref:`Features: Technical Documentation <features_technical>` page, this page aims to provide a resource for conceptually understanding the features: what are they, what are they meant to measure, and how is our operationalization connected to concepts from social science?

**Please note that this page is currently under construction.**
