.. _LSM:

LANGUAGE STYLE MATCHING
========================

High-Level Intuition
*********************
Language Style Matching (LSM) measures the degree to which individuals in a conversation align their linguistic styles. It reflects social dynamics like rapport, group cohesion, and interpersonal understanding by analyzing the similarity in function word usage (e.g., pronouns, conjunctions) between group members.

Implementation Basics 
**********************
The code computes LSM by analyzing the usage of specific function words (e.g., pronouns, conjunctions) by speakers in a conversation. It calculates the proportion of each function word type used by a speaker and compares it to the average usage of the same word type by other speakers in the same conversation. The formula for LSM reflects the similarity between these proportions, with higher values indicating greater alignment.

Implementation Notes/Caveats 
*****************************
This implementation adheres closely to the methodology described in the source paper, noting that our implementation does not include the calculation of Cronbach's alpha. However, there may be differences in how certain edge cases are handled, such as:
1. Conversations with only one speaker.
2. Instances where specific function word counts are zero, requiring safeguards to avoid division by zero errors.

Interpreting the Feature 
*************************
Read the code associated with this feature and answer the following questions, if applicable:

- LSM scores range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect linguistic alignment and 0 indicates no alignment. 
- The LSM scores for each sub-category of function words (e.g., pronouns) can be interpreted individually. Thus, for example, a high LSM score (e.g., 0.85) for pronouns suggests that a speaker's pronoun usage closely matches the average usage by other group members. A low LSM score (e.g., 0.2) suggests less alignment in pronoun usage.
- LSM does not capture the content or context of conversations. It focuses purely on function word alignment and may not reflect deeper social or relational dynamics.
- If a conversation has only one speaker, no LSM score is calculated.

Related Features 
*****************
This feature bears similarities with measures of mimicry (e.g., :ref:`mimicry_bert`, :ref:`moving_mimicry`), but focuses specifically on function words rather than semantic mimicry (similar to :ref:`function_word_accommodation`, but operationalized at the level of an overall conversation).
