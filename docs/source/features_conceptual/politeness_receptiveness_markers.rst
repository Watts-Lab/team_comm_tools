Implementation Basics 
**********************

We follow a very similar framework to the SECR Module to compute a 39 politeness features for each chat in a conversation. The chats are first preprocessed in the following ways:

1. Convert all words to lowercase
2. Remove/expand contractions (i.e don’t to do not; can’t to cannot; let’s to let us)
3. Ensure all characters are legal traditional A-Z alphabet letters by using corresponding RegExs

We then calculate the general categories of features in different ways, following similar structure as the SECR module.

1. count_matches and Adverb_Limiter: calculates features using a standard bag-of-words approach, detecting the number of keywords from a pre-specified list stored in keywords.py.
2. get_dep_pairs/get_dep_pairs_noneg: use Spacy to get dependency pairs for relevant words, using `token.dep_` to differentiate with negation.
3. Question: Question-related features are computed by counting the number of question words in a chat.
4. word_start: detect certain conjunctions/affirmation words using pre-specified dictionary

The corresponding counts are then returned concatenated to the original dataframe.
