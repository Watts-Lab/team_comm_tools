Implementation Basics 
**********************

The PolitenessStrategies framework in Convokit identifies linguistic aspects of politeness using an annotated corpus of requests.
It evaluates and operationalizes politeness theory components like indirection and deference, with a classifier achieving near-human performance across domains. 

Each utterance (message) and a Spacy object (to do the parsing) is parsed through the transform_utterance() method of a PolitenessStrategies instance.
This method "Extract politeness strategies for raw string inputs (or individual utterances)." It calculates the following politeness strategies:

please
please_start
hashedge
indirect_btw
hedges
factuality
deference
gratitude
apologizing
1st_person_pl
1st_person
1st_person_start
2nd_person
2nd_person_start
indirect_greeting
direct_question
direct_start
haspositive
hasnegative
subjunctive
indicative
