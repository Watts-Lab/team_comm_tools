FEATURE NAME
============

High-Level Intuition
*********************
High-level, what does this feature measure?

Citation
*********
Provide a citation of the relevant social science paper(s) and computational paper(s).

Implementation Basics 
**********************
Read the code associated with this feature and give an intuitive explanation of what the code does. How does the technical implementation link to the high-level concept?

Implementation Notes/Caveats 
*****************************
Read the code associated with this feature, as well as the internal Wiki page associated with the feature. Does our implementation deviate from the paper in any way? How might this affect someone's ability to interpret the feature?

If this is not applicable (e.g., the implementation is straightforward and there are no caveats), *delete this section.*

Interpreting the Feature 
*************************
Read the code associated with this feature and answer the following questions, if applicable:

1. Bounds of the score: 0-1
2. Concrete example: This is such a great day!

1. What are the bounds of the score? What does a high versus low score mean? (How should you read this score?)
2. Give a concrete example (e.g., negative score versus positive score)
3. What DOESN’T the score measure? That is, what does the score take into account, and what are some ways that it might not capture the high-level social science concept?
4. Are there any edge cases that we should be aware of? (e.g., if the conversation contains only one chat?) To the best of your knowledge, how does the code handle it?

Related Features 
*****************
Are there any related/similar features to this one? Is this part of an "umbrella" or group of features? Write about them here, and do your best to explain how they are different. Why would you use one implementation over the other?
