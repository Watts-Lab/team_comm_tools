Implementation Basics 
**********************

The Dale–Chall readability formula is a readability test that provides a numeric gauge of the comprehension difficulty that readers come upon when reading a text. It uses a list of 3000 words that groups of fourth-grade American students could reliably understand, considering any word not on that list to be difficult.

The formula for calculating the raw score of the Dale–Chall readability score (1948) is given below:

0.1579(difficult words ×100/words) + 0.0496(words/sentences)

Scores range from 0 - 10, details can be found below:
