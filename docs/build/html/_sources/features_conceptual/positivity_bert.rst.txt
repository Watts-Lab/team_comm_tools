Sentiment (RoBERTa)
===================

High-Level Intuition
*********************
This feature measures the positivity of a message using RoBERTa's generated valence sentiment markers.

Citation
*********
Twitter-roBERTa-base-sentiment model from the `Hugging Face Transformers library <https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment>`_.

Implementation Basics 
**********************
The code runs inference on the the Twitter-roBERTa-base-sentiment model to predict how relatively positive, negative, and neutral a message is on a 0-1 scale.

Implementation Notes/Caveats 
*****************************
This feature precomputes these valence ratings in the data preprocessing step and stores them locally; this essentially "caches" the sentiment markers, preventing the case where a user spends extra time regenerating these ratings on subsequent requests.


Interpreting the Feature 
*************************
This feature returns 3 general sentiment markers: **positive_bert**, **negative_bert**, and **neutral_bert**. Each score ranges from 0-1, and all three scores add up to 1. This feature measures the extent to which a particular utterance aligns with each label, relative to the other labels.

Related Features 
*****************
This feature is one of several that measure sentiment. Other sentiment-related features include Negative_Emotion and Positive_Emotion, which are attributes of :ref:`politeness_receptiveness_markers`; :ref:`textblob_polarity`; and LIWC (a relevant column name being positive_affect_lexical_per_100). A z-scored version of the positivity RoBERTa score is also included separately (:ref:`positivity_z_score`).
