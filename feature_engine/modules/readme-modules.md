# README: /modules subdirectory
In order to not have to reinvent the wheel, we will seek to leverage existing implementations as much as we can. To do so, we will leverage the Git Submodules feeature (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Git repos that are other peoples' implementations (or starter code, depedencies, and other key references) can be imported here for easy reference in the rest of the repository.
