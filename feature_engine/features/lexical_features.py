		This list comprehension is a bit complicated, since it embeds some preprocessing.
		- What we really want to do is return line.rstrip(). However, we have to also do the following:
		- We want to capture each word, so we have to append the string start (^) and string end ($) characters
		- We have to replace any cases where "**" occurs, as python throws an error
		- The escape character, backslash, also breaks python's regex , so we have to remove it

we are searching for inside the text.
