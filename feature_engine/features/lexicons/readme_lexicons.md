# Lexicons (feature_engine/features/lexicons/)
This is a folder for lexicon-based features. Some of the lexicons are proprietary, and therefore they are kept hidden on the .gitignore. 

List of lexicons in this folder:
- `liwc_lexicons/`: lexicons associated with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
- `PositiveWords.csv`: list of words associated with positivity; sourced from [this link](https://gist.github.com/mkulakowski2/4289437).
