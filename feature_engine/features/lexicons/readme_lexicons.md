# Lexicons (feature_engine/features/lexicons/)
This is a folder for lexicon-based features. Some of the lexicons are proprietary, and therefore they are kept hidden on the .gitignore. 

List of lexicons in this folder:
- `liwc_lexicons/`: lexicons associated with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
- `liwc_lexicons_small_test/`: smaller set of lexicons from LIWC for testing purposes
- `positive-words.txt`: a list from Hu and Liu, KDD-2004, [downloadable here](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/opinion-lexicon-English.rar)
