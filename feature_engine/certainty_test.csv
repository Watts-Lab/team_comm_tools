"I an open to you changing my mind on this issue"
"I don't think the guy is the a$$hole. Thoughts?"
"So who thinks the guy is an ass for asking his mother in law to learn english"
"I think that this person is not an asshole because, according to him, he was very polite while approaching the issue"
"I can see how the family is upset because they feel the mother was disrespected but I can also understand the guy's feelings. Why should he have to work as interpreter for his mother in law?"
"Yes, I think his feeling makes sense to me to. Who doesn't want to be independent."
"I was conflicted because I could understand his frustration however I feel he should have maybe discussed strategies with how to approach the mother in law with his wife first."
"His MIL has been here for 8 years. You would think she'd pick up some English by now."

"I think the guy is an asshole because for all his talk about how easy it is to use resources to learn a language, he didn't take the time to research WHY some people do not."
"I think he also tried to utilize other resources such as language learning apps to help her learn"

"Maybe she does have a problem with learning languages, but she could at least try."
"After the edit he done it made it sound like he really loves his family"
"I don't think the guy is wrong in asking her to learn more english being that she lives in America, but he has to understand she is older and may not have the patience or capacity to learn a lot of english."
"Learning a second language is easiest when you're a child for a reason. Your brain is wired differently then, which makes it easier."
"I think he tried to help her.Â  He gave her resources to use and she apparently didn't use them."
