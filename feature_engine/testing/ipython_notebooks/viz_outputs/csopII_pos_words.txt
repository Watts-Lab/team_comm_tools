do you think it would work better to have one of us start with a b etc and the other start with i and go backwards
                                                                    or just do our own stuff im fine with whatever
                                                                                                whatever you think
                                                   alright ill start with i and go backwards and see how that goes
                                                                i am not sure about c and d seems we can do better

                                                                                                     with f in 104

                                                                                    and a must be neighbors with b

                                               c f and g are at the lower ends of their ranges so i guess that would be good spots to optimize

                                          c  f has to be neighbors so to me it seems like we have to figure out if g is at a its best location

CONVERSATION KRBxELippfQyYaYN8_easy 
maybe we should come up with a strategy to start  like you work on placement and i optimize or i work from the bottom of the rule list or
                                                  sounds good  ive been going from the top of the rule list  want me to do something else
                                                                                             no lets try that and ill start at the bottom
                                                                   next time  now ill try optimizing from the bottom and you from the top
                                                                                                                                     okay

                                                     with optimizing maybe a good idea is to scan for students without restrictions first
                                                                                                                                good idea

                                                  holy moly
                                          oh boy here we go
                          k i think we keep the strat going
                                           it seems to work
                                                    i agree
                   okay not quite as bad as it couldve been
                              ill work from bottom up again
                                    sounds like a good plan
                                actually not bad pointswise
                                             g is kinda low
                                           yeah same with o
                             lets see if we can wiggle them
                                 im actually kinda confused
        yeah theres so much going on its hard to keep track
        it seems like im supposed to get more points in 108
                                          if i move m and o
                                     but the points go down
                                   wait what thats so weird
                            that actually shouldnt be right
                                                        lol
             is it because we also need to move p with them
                                i guess im okay with it tbh
                                                        hmm
                         ends up being pretty much the same
                                           still its better
true we might just have to settle with some unhappy campers
                                                         oh
                                                        ooh
                                    its actually not better
                                                        lol
                                                       welp
                                                        lol
                                       this seems good then
                yeah i think its the best were going to get

                                                                    good so far i think
                                                               g would be better in 104
should we assign one person to make changes and rest of us all make suggestions in chat
                                                                            more points
                                                            so that it is not confusing
                                                   b in 101 and a in 102 is more points
                                                                              good call
                                              okay now lets see how we can up the score
                                                  i wont make changes just suggest them
                                                             a and b should be switched
                                                             so that it is less chaotic
                                                                    would e in 104 work
                                                                                   nice
                                                                                   nice
                                                             is this the best we can do
i am looking to see which ones have 90 points and seeing if we can satisfy all of those
                                                                      whats the max 500
                                                       what happened we had it all good
                                                go back to what we had like 3 times ago
                                                             the other score was better
                                                          who is the one making changes
                                                                 green rewind that back
                                                                                  green
                            alright then green lets go back to our previous arrangement
                                                               put c back i n103 with d
                                                                          it was better
                                                                                     ok

                          may be we cant hit 500 this round it is ok if we hit mid 400s
                                                                   which we did earlier
                                                                                  right
                                              yeah 486 is what we had itt at thats fine
                                                        i cant figure out how to fix it

                                        itll decrease the score but its better than 100
                                                                                 ho red

                                                       so every rule is broken lol
                                                      wow were breaking every rule
                                                                                 d
                                        we managed to violate every constraint lol
                                i think we should try to keep f in 101 if possible
                                                        should get points for that
                                                       f has two very high options
                                                                       101 and 104
                                                               c and d both in 103
                                                thats a pretty decent score at 552
                                                                    552 looks good
                                            i feel like any score over 500 is good
                                          these sure are some contentious students
                                   i never got this much choice of room assignment
                                                                              nice

                         i saw us hit 660 with no violations but this isnt too bad
                                                           well over 500 were good
                                                    i thought 660 was rulebreaking
                                                        you could totally be right
                            750 is the total possible with highest ranked rooms   
                                                             581 seems pretty good
                                             can we get a somewhere theyre happier

                                         yeah i think this is too big a group size
                                               haha i just tried to make g happier

                                                     everyone has to click satisfy

                                                so far so good
                           oh are there more people than rooms

b should go to 101 that has the highest value right
                      but a and b must be neighbors
                     but has to be neighbors with a
                 right so a would have to go to 102
                             102 makes a less happy
        are you all satisfied with this arrangement
                 our score is now lower than it was
                           lets go back to original
                  because a and d cant be neihgbors
                                 now its even lower
             now were back in the 500s im satisfied
                      c and d have to live together
                       we are missing a requirement
                            so well lose 100 points
                                              there
CONVERSATION wbvzHu7BzNGQN7NLG_easy 
                             why do we want a in 101 and b in 102
                                        a and d cant be neighbors
                             thats fine lets put d in 104 for now
                                        a and b must be neighbors
                                      c and d have to be together
                                           okay so c and d in 105
                      do we all have the same list of constraints
                                                        yea we do
                                                       i think so
                                            104 is a popular room
if we put b in 101 then a must b 102 to satisfy all b constraints
                                              so we are at 539 rn
                                    can we swap rooms 101 and 103
                                        a and d cant be neighbors
                                                            right
                                              539 was best so far
                                                   with cd in 103
                                             and ab in 101 an 102
                                  is that the highest so far  586
                                                           so far
                                                       yep so far
                                               can g b 104 or 101
                                                               no
                                                             okay
                         what was the arrangement when it was 586
                                              i guess it was this
                                                 are we satisfied
