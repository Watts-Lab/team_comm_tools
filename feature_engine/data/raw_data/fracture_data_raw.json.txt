Many programs have merit, but limited resources require that you select the programs that you prefer to fund. You have discretionary funds available, and a number of projects are requesting access to these funds. Your group’s job is to select those that should receive support. Your personal goal in selecting projects for funding is to choose those programs that agree with your personal values. You have $500,000 total to allocate from this fund. Proposals received from various organizations for projects are listed below. Each project is in need of $500,000 but can benefit from any contribution that you might make.

Many programs have merit, but limited resources require that you select the programs that you prefer to fund. You have discretionary funds available, and a number of projects are requesting access to these funds. Your group’s job is to select those that should receive support. Your personal goal in selecting projects for funding is to choose those programs that agree with your personal values. You have $500,000 total to allocate from this fund. Proposals received from various organizations for projects are listed below. Each project is in need of $500,000 but can benefit from any contribution that you might make. The greater the contribution that you make to a particular project, the more likely it is that the chosen project will succeed.

Many programs have merit, but limited resources require that you select the programs that you prefer to fund. You have discretionary funds available, and a number of projects are requesting access to these funds. Your group’s job is to select those that should receive support. Your personal goal in selecting projects for funding is to choose those programs that agree with your personal values. You have $500,000 total to allocate from this fund. Proposals received from various organizations for projects are listed below. Each project is in need of $500,000 but can benefit from any contribution that you might make. The greater the contribution that you make to a particular project, the more likely it is that the chosen project will succeed.

You have discretionary funds available, and a number of projects are requesting access to these funds. Your group’s job is to select those that should receive support. Your personal goal in selecting projects for funding is to choose those programs that agree with your personal values. You have $500,000 total to allocate from this fund. Proposals received from various organizations for projects are listed below. Each project is in need of $500,000 but can benefit from any contribution that you might make.
