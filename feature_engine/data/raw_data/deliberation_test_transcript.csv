30,51.956,55.956, So I guess how did you guys say you feel about the police?,0,1.0
31,53.382999999999996,58.382999999999996, to people of different races from the police that have been unjust or unfair.,1,1.0
32,55.701,62.701, Maybe I can start and I can take some examples from a perspective from my home country as well.,2,1.0
33,58.382999999999996,61.382999999999996, I don't see that as day to day where I'm from.,1,1.0
34,61.382999999999996,63.382999999999996, And so I have a cousin who's a police officer.,1,1.0
35,62.701,68.701, I have interacted with police with regards to my passport verification.,2,1.0
36,63.382999999999996,66.383," You know, I've seen them around town, but like I've never been to jail,",1,1.0

38,68.701,76.701," And just the traffic police, not the regular police.",2,1.0
39,70.383,73.383," And so for me, they're like, it's a, they're positive overall.",1,1.0
40,73.383,77.383," But I do acknowledge that they, I think it varies a lot by region",1,1.0
41,76.701,84.701," And yeah, we are always, I mean, most most of us are sort of slightly scared as to because it's usually associated with you have done something wrong.",2,1.0
43,77.383,80.383, and by individual police officer.,1,1.0
44,80.383,83.383," Yeah, I agree with that.",1,1.0
45,83.383,87.383," I feel like they're good overall, but they're not a perfect organization",1,1.0
46,84.701,95.701," And in terms of taking help in case of any incident, I personally haven't had the opportunity to interact with them.",2,1.0
48,87.383,90.383, or how necessarily perfectly like blanket rules.,1,1.0
49,90.383,96.383," That like the whole country might spy, for example.",1,1.0
51,95.701,99.701," So I think based on that, I would say slightly negatively.",2,1.0
52,96.383,98.383, I'll start on this one.,1,1.0
53,98.383,101.383, So I just finished reading a book called The Senda's Shining.,1,1.0
54,99.701,106.701," And here, here again, I haven't had the opportunity of just came here a few months back in the US.",2,1.0
55,101.383,106.383," It's about Anthony Hinton, who was sentenced to death row in Alabama for 30 years.",1,1.0
57,106.383,108.383, Even though he was innocent.,1,1.0
58,106.701,115.701, I had the opportunity to interact with the local police. I think it's been a very steady.,2,1.0
59,108.383,112.383, And it was because he was in the system for having like stolen a car when he was younger.,1,1.0
61,112.383,116.383," And the police basically came to him and pinned like three murders on him,",1,1.0
62,115.701,122.701," We have these, they are a scots, right? Though can escort you to your place if there's night.",2,1.0
63,116.383,120.383," even though he had alibi's am like, could prove that it wasn't him.",1,1.0
64,120.383,128.383," And I mean, Alabama is definitely like a location that is very, very like historically racist towards blacks.",1,1.0
66,122.701,128.701, So it was very friendly and didn't seem to have any negative effect.,2,1.0
67,128.383,132.383, And so I feel like you hear stories like that and talk about stories like that.,1,1.0
68,128.701,139.701," So from again, just to add on to that, what I listen, see in the news, I think that has also I have some opinions from based on that as well.",2,1.0
70,132.383,135.383, And I think that I'm sure it still is a problem.,1,1.0
71,135.383,138.383," I mean, that was in the 1980s through like the 2015.",1,1.0
72,138.383,141.383, So it was like a fairly recent like time period that happened.,1,1.0
73,139.701,146.701, But happy to hear both of you first.,2,1.0
75,141.383,144.383, And so I think that there definitely is problems in it.,1,1.0
76,144.383,149.383, But I do think that it is more geographical than like a police officer.,1,1.0
77,149.383,156.383, By just being a police officer.,1,1.0
78,156.383,158.383," I like to talk both of you guys said, Brandon.",1,1.0
79,158.383,160.383, I liked your perspective.,1,1.0
81,160.383,164.383, You brought up about how is it more of a systemic thing versus like the individual police officer.,1,1.0
82,164.383,176.383," And I have heard like in the news and especially the last probably like 10, 10 years of a bunch of different court cases where they'll bring up somebody who's why who doesn't get sentenced to something very long,",1,1.0
84,176.383,180.383," even though the exact same person that was black, I like a really awful sentence.",1,1.0
85,179.701,205.701," Yeah, especially people who are working with the criminal justice system and all of that, I think they would have moved.",2,1.0
86,180.383,191.383," So yeah, is it just the police are like the tip of the system or is actually the police or is like the whole, you know, government coming down into it.",1,1.0
87,191.383,195.383," Okay, yeah, moving on.",1,1.0
90,195.383,201.383, And I'm sure the police be more should need the police be involved in more fewer aspects of public life.,1,1.0
91,201.383,204.383, I don't feel like they're involved in that many aspects of public life.,1,1.0
92,204.383,208.383," I'm like parades, stop signs, you know, directing traffic.",1,1.0
94,205.701,217.701," I think again, my knowledge is from the news, from some of the readings that I've done as part of my course.",2,1.0
95,208.383,214.383, I don't know. What do you guys do feel like they're very involved?,1,1.0
97,214.383,217.383," Yeah, I mean, I agree with you guys what you said so far.",1,1.0
98,217.383,219.383, I don't have a super strong opinion on this.,1,1.0
99,217.701,231.701, I was I was taking this course in data science for public policy last semester and there was a case study around this as to in terms of shootings.,2,1.0
100,219.383,223.383," I feel like overall at least in my personal life, they're not super involved.",1,1.0
102,223.383,229.383," Sparse like you said, like, is your speeding I gig out like I've been pulled over before for speeding on ticket.",1,1.0
103,229.383,236.383," I am sometimes I wish they weren't involved in speeding, but I also recognize that that's a public safety issue.",1,1.0
105,231.701,244.701," And who in terms of race, which race is experienced more shootings from the police and the data was, I mean, it was very complicated in terms of we had to take in a lot of factors.",2,1.0
106,236.383,240.383," Yeah, parties or I don't know just like being around.",1,1.0
107,240.383,245.383," I'm trying to like think if I was in another person's position like for example,",1,1.0
108,244.701,260.701," But yeah, there was the I think the last point that the study made was or the findings were that there is definitely some some some racial bias for that what could be the reasons for that will be different as I think Rachel mentioned could be geographic and it could be very.",2,1.0
110,246.383,253.383," you know, in this house somewhere where there is more racism or things that are more like it just engrained into the society.",1,1.0
113,253.383,266.383," And I'm not sure because I know like historically, you know, you have police officers that really would harass people or you know really enforce like walking on a certain side of the street or not, you know, like not, you know, black sitting on like the back of it.",1,1.0
115,260.701,272.701, Individual it could also be depending on you are not collecting all the data also so we have to very careful of the studies as well where the data is coming from and all of that.,2,1.0
117,266.383,271.383, The back of the bus or not being able to go to certain like restaurants or pools or things.,1,1.0
118,272.383,275.383, I feel like stuff like that obviously should not be.,1,1.0
119,272.701,285.701," So I mean, police I made of people and people can be racist and that will reflect in not just police in in in other jobs as well.",2,1.0
120,275.383,281.383, But that's not really anymore. I don't think there's places like that anymore that don't like what people like this aggregation.,1,1.0
123,281.383,291.383," So yeah, I feel like me like I feel I'm neutral. I'm like I feel like they don't need to be involved anymore or any less.",1,1.0
124,285.701,303.701," So I think I think I think the question is, is the system of policing inherently which makes people who are let's say not so much racist and enable them to be racist I think that's maybe something that.",2,1.0
125,291.383,299.383," But necessarily, I'd also agree with the fact that you said that like if there's areas really like low response times to like crime shootings or things like that.",1,1.0
126,299.383,306.383, It would be great if they walked a little bit more. There was more police to be able to respond to those if it's like a staffing issue.,1,1.0
127,306.383,309.383, So.,1,1.0
132,322.383,333.383, What is the best way to deal with the problem of urban unrest and rioting? Is it more important to call unrest with more sort of prevent it by addressing internal issues of police misconduct and racism?,1,1.0
135,334.383,354.383," Yeah, my initial thought doesn't have a lot to do with necessarily this kind of deracism, but it was what are the systems in place to allow people to what they're unrest be known.",1,1.0
139,353.956,354.956, I agree.,0,1.0
140,354.956,358.956, I think there's also like two questions that people can play at,0,1.0
141,355.383,369.383," Because Brandon, my first I was with you said like whenever people go crazy start stealing and you know, the analyzing things and yeah, I think the police should be able to like use force to protect property that's not involved in any way and the riot or you know the protesting.",1,1.0
142,356.701,361.701, I think the thing is that the law is not a law.,2,1.0
143,358.956,368.956, the same time.,0,1.0
144,361.701,364.701, I think the law is not a law.,2,1.0
147,368.956,376.956, I think that's really tough to delineate between.,0,1.0
148,369.383,379.383, But I just think it does become a governmental issue. Like do we need to have better ways to get feedback from the people incorporate it and make people feel heard that their things that they're worried about are.,1,1.0
152,376.956,381.956," But at the same time, like you definitely do see, you know,",0,1.0
153,379.383,382.383, I don't know how realistic that is.,1,1.0
